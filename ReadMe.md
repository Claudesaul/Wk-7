## TRAGEDY AT MACHINE LEARNING MANOR:
 Professor Reginald "Regressor" Fisher has been found dead in his study, struck by a vintage calculating machine during the Statistical Learning Conference. Eight suspects were present during the estimated time of death. The investigation will require branching out beyond obvious patterns, as the roots of this crime may run deeper than initial models suggest.
