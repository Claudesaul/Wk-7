        "**TRAGEDY AT MACHINE LEARNING MANOR**: Renowned data scientist Professor Reginald \"Regressor\" Fisher has been found dead in his study during the annual International Conference on Statistical Learning. The cause of death appears to be blunt force trauma from what investigators believe to be a vintage calculating machine. Professor Fisher, famous for his work on predictive algorithms and pattern recognition, was found by his colleague Dr. Emma Clarke at approximately 10:30 PM last night. The Manor's security system recorded eight individuals on the premises at the time of the murder, all of whom are now persons of interest. Preliminary forensic analysis suggests the murder occurred between 9:15 PM and 9:45 PM, during the evening reception.\n",

        "**Detective's Note**: _You've been called in as data science detectives to solve this case using your machine learning expertise. Eight suspects were at the manor during the time of the murder. Each has motives, alibis, and various characteristics that may point to their guilt or innocence. A clever murderer might try to appear innocent in most ways, with only a few tell-tale signs of guilt. Your job is to analyze the evidence and identify the killer using the techniques you've learned in class._\n",
